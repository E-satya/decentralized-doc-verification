# Decentralized Document Verification System

A decentralized system for secure document verification using blockchain and IPFS (via Thirdweb API). The system enables two main user roles:
1. **Uploaders**: Upload documents to a decentralized network for secure storage.
2. **Verifiers**: Verify the integrity of documents by comparing stored document hashes on the blockchain.

## Tech Stack
- **Next.js**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **Hardhat**: Ethereum development environment for deploying smart contracts.
- **Thirdweb API**: Used for uploading documents to IPFS.
- **IPFS**: Decentralized storage system for files.
- **Solidity**: Smart contract language for Ethereum.

## Features
- **Decentralized File Storage**: Documents are stored securely on IPFS.
- **Blockchain Hashing**: Document hashes are stored on the blockchain to ensure integrity and transparency.
- **Two User Roles**: Uploaders and Verifiers interact with the system.
- **Security and Transparency**: No central authority controls the storage or verification process.
